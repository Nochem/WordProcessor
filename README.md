# WordProcessor
This program takes written text and constructs a graph based on the order of occurance of the words within.
The graph can then be traversed with a visitor pattern using the iterators and pointers offered by the Container class.

Suggested uses of th
to either suggest words whilst writing, attempt to auto-generate humanlike text or potentially
used for spelling correction.
