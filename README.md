# WordProcessor
This program takes written text and constructs a graph based on the order of occurance of the words in the given text.
The graph can then be traversed with a visitor pattern using the iterators and pointers offered by the Container class.

Suggested uses of this program could be to suggest words whilst writing, attempt to auto-generate humanlike text or used for spelling correction.
